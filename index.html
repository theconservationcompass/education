            <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
            <p>Conservation is the active management of the Earth's natural resources, species, and ecosystems to ensure their long-term survival. As humans, we depend on nature for everything, from clean air and water to food and medicine. Yet, the rapid pace of development and human activities like deforestation, pollution, and overexploitation are threatening the planet’s biodiversity. Conservation aims to protect not only individual species but also the ecosystems they depend on, ensuring the balance of nature is maintained for future generations. Without effective conservation efforts, the delicate interdependence of species and habitats could collapse, leading to the loss of vital resources and the degradation of ecosystems that support life on Earth.</p>
