        <h1>Why we started this project</h1>
        <p>The Conservation Compass emerged from the combined efforts of two people with different but complementary backgrounds. One of us works in conservation and research, witnessing firsthand the importance of preserving biodiversity and telling the stories of ecosystems and species that often go unheard. Whether through conversations with colleagues or curious friends, we saw a real interest in learning more about how we protect biodiversity and preserve ecosystems. This project was born out of a desire to share those stories with a wider audience—to make the complex world of conservation more approachable, inspiring, and engaging.
        </p>
         <p> The other half of our team comes from a background in computer science and data. Driven by a desire to use technology for meaningful purposes, this project became an opportunity to not only apply data skills but also to learn more about the natural world and its challenges. We wanted to explore the power of open-source data in conservation. With an abundance of information available through resources like the National Biodiversity Network, there’s an opportunity to bring data-driven insights directly to the public, empowering people to visualise and better understand the challenges and solutions in global conservation.
        </p>
         <p>  The Conservation Compass aims to be a space where these two passions—storytelling and data—come together to guide more people through the essential work of conservation.</p>
